Hey! So here's a look at some of my process and thinking for this exercise.

##What's the problem?


##Building it
###HTML
For the moment I'm usingHarp for templating, which preprocesses with Jade. 

###CSS
I'm increasingly of the atomic CSS mindsetâ€”it's verbose, but it provides a lot more clarity when I've gotta navigate larger stylesheets, and makes incremental changes a lot smoother. Semantic classes are still used for structure and targetting, but rarely if ever have anything presentational attached to them. 
I dig SASS

_Design Exercise_

Hey! So here's a look a process and thinking.

##HTML
I'm currently using Harp for templating, which processes with Jade. 

##CSS
I'm increasingly of the atomic CSS mindsetâ€”it's verbose, but it provides a lot more clarity when I've gotta navigate larger stylesheets, and makes incremental changes a lot smoother. Semantic classes are still used for structure and targetting, but rarely if ever have anything presentational attached to them. 
I dig SASS
